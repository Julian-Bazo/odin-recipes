    <h2>Preparation</h2>

            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic, saute until the onion becomes translucent (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces to the skillet, season them with salt and pepper, and cook until browned (approximately 5-6 minutes per side).</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add mushrooms and cook for 5-7 minutes until they release their moisture and begin to brown.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken to the skillet and stir in the chicken broth, heavy cream, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese, then season with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and serve over cooked rice, pasta, or mashed potatoes.</li>
